# bamazon-mysql-node


**Bamazon** is a node application where you can buy items
from a list of products, we will use **MySQL Database** to populate 
the the pre-defined products within our bamazon database to the node app.


To start out the app you will be prompted a list
of products you can purchase, as well as an input asking 
what product you would like to buy, every product has a unique ID. 
Based on the product you would like to purchase, all you have to do
is type in the products ID in the input.. **Example Below.**

After you input the product ID, a prompt will
appear asking you how many units of that product
you would like to purchase.. **Example Below.**

Once you specify how many units of the product
you would like to purchase you will be prompted a

 as well as a message displaying your total $. **Example Below.**

If you input **"Y"** the app will restart with updated quanity.
If you input **"N"** a message will appear that will say thank you for shopping Bamazon.

Side notes: if you want to purchase an item and specify how many units 
you would like to buy, but the quanity is insufficient a message will appear.

If you input an invalid ID an error message will appear.
