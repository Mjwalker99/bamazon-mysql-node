# bamazon-mysql-node


**Bamazon** is a node application where you can buy items
from a list of products, we will use **MySQL Database** to populate 
the the pre-defined products within our bamazon database to the node app.


To start out the app you will be prompted a list
of products you can purchase, as well as an input asking 
what product you would like to buy, every product has a unique ID. 
Based on the product you would like to purchase, all you have to do
is type in the products ID in the input.. **Example Below.**
